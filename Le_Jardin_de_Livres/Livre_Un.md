## Habit Forming Products

A 2011 university study suggested people check their phones thirty-four times per day. However, industry insiders believe that number is closer to an astounding 150 daily sessions.


**Face it: We’re hooked.** 

**The technologies we use have turned into compulsions...** It’s the impulse to check a message notification...visit YouTube, Facebook, or Twitter for just a few minutes, only to find yourself still tapping and scrolling an hour later. 

The products and services we use habitually alter our everyday behavior, just as their designers intended. **Our actions have been engineered.** How do companies, producing little more than bits of code displayed on a screen, seemingly control users’ minds? **What makes some products so habit forming?**

### Product Types: Vitamin vs Painkiller

“Are you building a vitamin or painkiller?” is a common, almost clichéd question many investors ask.

_Painkillers_ solve an obvious need, relieving a specific pain, and often have quantifiable markets. _Vitamins_, by contrast, do not necessarily solve an obvious pain point. Instead they appeal to users’ emotional rather than functional needs.

Unlike a painkiller, without which we cannot function, missing a few days of vitamin popping, say while on vacation, is no big deal. **So perhaps managers and investors know best? Perhaps building painkillers, not vitamins, is always the right strategy. Not so fast.**

**A habit is when not doing an action causes a bit of pain.** It is important to clarify that the term pain, as it is frequently used in business school and marketing books, is somewhat hyperbolic. In reality, the experience we are talking about is more similar to an itch, a feeling that manifests within the mind and causes discomfort until it is satisfied. The habit-forming products we use are simply there to provide some sort of relief. Using a technology or product to scratch the itch provides faster satisfaction than ignoring it. Once we come to depend on a tool, nothing else will do.
